# FacialRecognition_MiniProject

The first file contains the answer to the first two questions of the quiz commited with flag "answers 1 and 2"

The second file contains a modified code, where I removed the plotting code, (which mainly breaks with n_component value = 10)
and the whole part is put inside a loop for simplicity. The results are noted within the code.
